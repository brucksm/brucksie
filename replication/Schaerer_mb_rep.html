  Imagine that you recently purchased a digital music player and therefore want to sell all of your old CDs. The CD is in reasonably good condition, with no scratches and an intact case.

  Another buyer has offered you $8 for the CD. Thus, if you can’t reach an agreement in the current negotiation, you will get $8 for the CD.”
